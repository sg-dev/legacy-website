Risks in economic networks: Increasing complexity, cascading failures, global dependencies

In my talk, I discuss different sources of risk in economic systems and ways to model them using formal agent-based and data-driven models.

Increasing complexity: Economic systems are often represented as networks, to address the interactions between economic agents. Examples are financial transfers between banks, but also relations between firms and cities. More important, but less understood, is the coupling between different network layers, each representing a particular type of relation, such as ownership, R\&D collaborations. Within and across layers, risk can spread in various and often unconsidered ways. Risk can further emerge from the fact that in many cases we have only aggregated information about agents (e.g. financial intermediaries), but no detailed information about their interactions.

Cascading failures: For the propagation of failures within and across network layers details matter: network size and topology, coupling strengths, redistribution mechanisms, agent's fragility, impact of external shocks. Formal agent-based models that still allow to estimate the resulting cascade sizes are discussed. 

Global dependencies: As an application scenario, a data-driven model of cascades in the international crop trade network is presented. Similar to supply chains, external shocks on food suppliers (countries) impact importers not only directly, but also indirectly, but the latter is difficult to quantify. A systematic study of shock scenarios is still possible and allows to calculate different indicators for systemic risk.
